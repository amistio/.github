# Amistio

Amistio is a contract and subscription manager built around one idea: trust comes from clarity and control. It helps you keep track of what you’ve signed up for, understand what happens if you do nothing, and set reminders you choose yourself.

## What we’re building

People miss renewals and cancellation windows because contracts fade into the background. Amistio doesn’t “handle it for you”. It makes the details easier to review, keeps everything explicit, and stays out of your way.

## Principles

- No automatic contract creation
- No automatic cancellations
- No silent assumptions or inferred values
- No actions taken on your behalf
- Calm, plain language in the interface (no “AI assistant” framing)
- Privacy-first by default
